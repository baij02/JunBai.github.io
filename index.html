					<p>As a highly motivated and ambitious individual, I am excited to embark on the next chapter of my professional journey as I anticipate my <b> graduation in the Spring of 2023</b>. With a broad range of interests spanning the cutting-edge fields of <b>machine learning, data mining, computer vision, bioinformatics, and medical image analysis,</b> I am eager to contribute my skills and expertise to a dynamic and innovative organization. I have honed my abilities and gained valuable experience through a combination of coursework and hands-on projects, positioning me as a well-rounded and adaptable candidate, ready to hit the ground running in a diverse array of roles. I am confident in my ability to make a meaningful impact in any position within these fields and am eagerly looking forward to exploring the various opportunities available to me.</p>
					
					<p>As a distinguished Ph.D. candidate from the esteemed University of Connecticut Computer Science and Engineering Department, I have had the privilege of working under the guidance of renowned researcher, Dr. Sheida Nabavi, in her esteemed lab. Over the past few years, I have devoted myself to the development of cutting-edge deep learning and traditional computer vision methods to analyze a diverse range of medical images, including X-ray images, Computed Tomosynthesis (CT), histological images, and cell images. My research encompasses a broad spectrum of tasks, including classification, segmentation, synthesizing, and reconstructing images, and has led to significant advancements in the fields of cancer diagnosis, disease prediction, and object reconstruction. My contributions to these fields have been substantial, and I am honored to have played a part in advancing the state of the art in medical image analysis. I am eager to continue my research and make more impactful contributions to this field in the future.</p>
					
					<p> <b>I love research and teaching.</b> They are both important in the field of academia. Research allows for the discovery and advancement of new knowledge and understanding in a particular field. Teaching helps to disseminate this knowledge to the next generation of scholars and practitioners. Together, research and teaching form a symbiotic relationship, with research informing teaching and teaching providing a means to apply and expand upon the knowledge gained through research.</p>
