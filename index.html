					<p>I am on the market with expected graduation in the Spring 2023. Im broadly interested in <b>machine learning, data mining, computer vision, bioinformatics, and medical image analysis</b> positions.</p>
					
					<p>I am currently a Ph.d. candidate from University of Connecticut Computer Sicence and Engineering Department. I work in Dr. Sheida Nabavi's lab. In the past few years, I spend my time to develop deep learning methods and traditional computer vision methods to analysis medical images includes X-ray images, Computed Tomosynthesis (CT), histological image and cell images. The tasks of my research broad to classification, segmentation, synthesising, and reconstructing images. My research contributed to cancer diagnostic, diease prediction, and reconstructing objects.</p>
					
					<p> <b>I love research and teaching.</b> They are both important in the field of academia. Research allows for the discovery and advancement of new knowledge and understanding in a particular field. Teaching helps to disseminate this knowledge to the next generation of scholars and practitioners. Together, research and teaching form a symbiotic relationship, with research informing teaching and teaching providing a means to apply and expand upon the knowledge gained through research.</p>
