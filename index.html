		The advent of digital breast tomosynthesis has transformed the landscape of breast imaging diagnosis, thrusting it to unprecedented levels of precision and accuracy. However, despite these remarkable advancements, the automatic detection of breast cancer using the high-resolution, high-volume, and complex images generated by digital breast tomosynthesis has remained a formidable challenge. To conquer this challenge, our research team has embarked on a pioneering journey of developing a revolutionary model for the detection of cancerous 3D mammogram images. In this groundbreaking study, we have developed an innovative model for more precise detection of cancerous 3D mammogram images. This novel model firstly represents 3D mammograms as graphs, then uses a self-attention graph convolutional neural network model to effectively and efficiently learn the features of 3D mammograms, and finally, by utilizing the extracted features, identifies the cancerous 3D mammograms with unparalleled accuracy. This proposed model will undoubtedly pave the way for more efficient and effective breast cancer diagnosis, and a major step forward in the fight against this devastating disease.

		The rapid expansion of global connectivity and urbanization has created a perfect storm for the spread of disease on a worldwide scale. The outbreak of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic has placed immense strain on healthcare systems, particularly in the area of intensive care units. In light of this dire situation, the accurate prognosis of patients' need for intensive care units at the earliest stage of hospital admission has become a top priority, in order to ensure efficient allocation of resources. To this end, we have proposed a groundbreaking clinical data structured graph Markov neural network embedding with computed radiography exam features (CGMNN) to predict the intensive care units demand for COVID-19 patients. This innovative approach utilizes patient chest radiography and clinical data collected at the early stages of hospitalization to make more accurate diagnoses, ensuring that patients receive the care they need in a timely and efficient manner.

		Prostate cancer is a global scourge, afflicting men worldwide and ranking as the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. One of the key prognostic features in prostate cancer is the Gleason grading of histopathology images. This grading system, which is based on the tumor architecture of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSI) is assigned by pathologists and is known to be both time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have been employed to analyze histopathology images, with promising results in the grading of prostate cancer. However, these algorithms rely on fully annotated datasets, which are both costly and time-consuming to generate. In this work, we propose a novel weakly-supervised algorithm to classify prostate cancer grades. The proposed algorithm is composed of three steps: (1) extracting discriminative areas in a histopathology image by utilizing the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) algorithm based on Transformers, (2) representing the image by constructing a graph using the discriminative patches, and (3) classifying the image into its Gleason grades by developing a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) based on the gated attention mechanism. This innovative algorithm is set to revolutionize the field of prostate cancer diagnosis and pave the way for more accurate, efficient, and cost-effective treatment of this devastating disease.<br/>

	    <p>  <br><br><strong>Molecular dynamics simulation to uncover the mechanisms of protein instability during freezing</strong><br />
		Freezing is a widely used technique in the pharmaceutical industry for the preservation and transportation of biotherapeutics. In order to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanisms and molecular details of protein destabilization upon freezing, multi-scale molecular dynamics simulations of Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) protein in phosphate buffer with/without ice formation were performed. The simulations were conducted under both fast and slow ice-growing conditions at 243 K, from one or two sides of the simulation box, respectively. The results showed that the rate of ice formation at all-atom simulations was crucial to the stability of LDH, as faster freezing rates resulted in enhanced structural stability and a higher number of intramolecular hydrogen bonds, less flexible protein residues, lower solvent accessibility, and greater structural compactness. Additionally, protein aggregation was investigated through coarse-grained simulations and was found to be initiated by extended protein structures and retained by electrostatic interactions of salt bridges between charged residues and hydrogen bonds between polar residues of the protein. Lastly, the study of the free energy of dissociation through steered molecular dynamics simulation revealed that LDH was destabilized by the solvation of the hydrophobic core and the loss of hydrophobic interactions. This study, for the first time, provides experimentally validated molecular simulations that reveal the detailed mechanisms of LDH destabilization upon ice formation and cryoconcentration of solutes, and it will help to improve the preservation and transportation of biotherapeutics.
